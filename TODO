Test coverage could be improved, for example testing that fields inherited
from superclasses work correctly in all cases.

It would be useful to be able to modify the various SEntity subclasses and
reconstruct a serial stream from the modified objects.  This would allow you
to construct a new version of an object with changed contents.  But it is a
decidedly non-trivial task.
